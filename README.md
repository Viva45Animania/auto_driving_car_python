this repository consists of a python CLI application for the purposes of a interview question to simulate a program that takes into account a car that self drives on a fixed grid set by the user and follows a set of instructions to move around the defined field.

this was developed with TDD in mind to showcase thinking about the tests that come with the question and writing the simplest code to pass the test.
it was also taken into consideration that the program should be modular and scalable by utilising OOP and SOLID concepts to ensure clean coding practices

for the interview question, please refer to the file, auto_driving_car.md
